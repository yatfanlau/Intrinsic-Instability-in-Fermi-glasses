# Intrinsic Instability in Fermi Glass

We study in this paper the effect of weak, short-ranged repulsive interaction on disordered metals. Through analysing the interaction matrix elements between different eigenstates of the noninteracting and corresponding Hartree-Fock single-particle Hamiltonian, we argue that the Fermi
glass state is unstable towards formation of magnetic moments for repulsive interaction and formation of local fermion pairs for attractive interaction as a result of localized single-particle eigenstates around the Fermi surface. Numerical simulations are performed to verify our analysis. We further
propose within a Landau Fermi-liquid type framework that our result is applicable for general electronic systems with weak, short-ranged interaction as long as the quasi-particle states exist and are
localized, suggesting that Fermi glass state is intrinsically unstable.
